Bioinformatics :: Epidemiology - Cellular Automata
==================================================
This Mathematica project is a teaching aid for exploring the dynamics of disease using a cellular automaton.

Main repository on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/arthanzel/bioinformatics)
.
- `DiseaseModeling.nb`: Interactive Mathematica notebook that introduces the concept of cellular automata and how they relate to epidemilogy.
- `GlobalAutomata.nb`: Unfinished but functional Mathematica notebook that explores *global automata*, a type of cellular automaton where every cell influences every other cell in the system.
- `DiseaseLibrary.wl`: Mathematica library file that evaluates cellular automata.
- `Mikler... .pdf`: Original journal article that inspired this project.
- `Slides.pdf`: Lecture slides used in this project's interactive demo at the University of Ottawa.
